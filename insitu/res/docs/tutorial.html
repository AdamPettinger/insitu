        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to InSitu!</h1>
        <p>InSitu organizes task views using a hierarchy of <strong>Modes</strong>, <strong>Views</strong>, and<strong> Filters</strong>. <strong>Modes</strong> serve as analogues for different operating modes, such as navigation, manipulation, or survey, and are displayed in a tab bar at the top of the application. Modes serve as containers for <strong>Views</strong>, which display a ROS image stream, such as the feed from an end effector camera. <strong>Views</strong> can be augmented with useful information by adding <strong>Filters</strong>, which can range from a simple heartbeat indicator to a full on AR overlay. For example, a typical rover setup might have a navigation <strong>Mode</strong> containing front and rear camera <strong>Views</strong> with base odometry and LiDAR <strong>Filters</strong>.</p>
        <p>To create a mode, select <code>Edit-&gt;New Mode</code> from the menu bar or press <code>Ctrl+Shift+M</code> to bring up the mode creation dialog.</p>
        <p>To create a view, ensure there is an active mode and select <code>Edit-&gt;New View</code> from the menu bar or press <code>Ctrl+Shift+V</code> to bring up the view creation dialog.</p>
        <p>To create a filter, ensure there is an active view and select <code>Edit-&gt;New Filter</code> from the menu bar or press <code>Ctrl+Shift+F</code> to bring up the view creation dialog.</p>
